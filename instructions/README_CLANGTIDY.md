All clang-tidy rules are written in .clang-tidy file and are applied automatically when we run code analysis.

Use the C/C++: Run Code Analysis on all files command from the Command Palette (F1, Ctrl+Shift+P).

See the problems in the terminal (tab problems), or lines are underscored (mouse over to read the problem).

You can add excluded paths to devcontainer.json to ignore analysis on those paths (for example, out folder).
